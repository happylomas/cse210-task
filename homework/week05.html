        <h2>Inheritance</h2>
        <h3>Explain the meaning of Inheritance</h3>
        <p>- Inheritance in proramming is just the same in real world. It is a concpet where one class inherites,
             or automatically gain access to methods and attributes from another class.
        </p>
        <h3>Highlight a benefit of Inheritance</h3>
        <p>- Inheritance helps reduces duplication, centralizes common logic.</p>
        <p>- Inheritance Makes it easier for programmers  to maintain  code and avoide too many changes when developing a program.</p>
        <p>- It helps programmers to reuse a code or function instead of rewriting a code over and over again.</p>
        
        <h3>Application of Inheritance</h3>
        <p>- Inheritance are mainly use in letting a class obtain attributes and methods of another class that is called the parent class.</p>
        <p>- For example. In the Mindfulness program I created, Activity is a base class that holds shared data (name, description, duration) 
            and common helper methods (showing the starting/ending messages, spinner animation, countdown). 
            Each specific activity — breathing, reflecting, and listing — inherits from Activity.
        </p>

<h1></h1>
            <p>***Base class (shared behavior)***</p>
            <p>public class Activity</p>
            <p>protected string _name;</p>
            <p>protected string _description;</p>
            <p>protected int _duration;</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>public void DisplayEndingMessage()</p>
            <p>public void DisplayStartingMessage()</p>
            <p>
            </p>
<h1></h1>
            <p>***Derived class (inherited behavior)***</p>

            <p>public class ReflectingActivity : Activity</p>

            <p>DisplayStartingMessage();     (inherited  method)</p>
            <p>DisplayEndingMessage();       (inherited  method)</p>


        <!-- <h3>Example of Encapsulation</h3>
        <p>- This is a program that help primary student memorize Scripture verses.</p>
        <p>- Now we have a class called Reference, this class has virables that we kept private, and also a constructor that 
            tells us how we can display them. There's also a getter, and then a display function that is public.
        </p>
        <p>- And we have other classes that help the program, but cannot maipulate these private objects."</p>
        <p>- Encapsulation simply make it possible for us to keep things we don't wish to keep changing in a private mode.</p>
