        <h2>Abstraction</h2>
        <h3>Explain the meaning of Abstraction</h3>
        <p>- Abstraction is the proccess of understanding complex idea 
            and dividing it into smaller or simple proccess. At the end making it look 
            easier and more understandable.
        </p>
        <h3>Highlight a benefit of Abstraction</h3>
        <p>- Abstraction help to reduce the complexity of a code</p>
        <p>- Makes it easier to read and maintain a code or programe</p>
        <p>- It helps programmers to reuse a code or function instead of rewriting a code over and over again.</p>
        <h3>Application of Abstraction</h3>
        <p>- programmers use abstraction in Object and Class oriented programming. 
            For instance a building can be seen as an object, that holds so many part of the building, the windows, door bed etc
            While a class can be seen as a method that carries out the action, example calculate the size of the windows, doors bed etc
        </p>
        <h3>Example of Abstraction</h3>
        <p>- Consider this as an App that prompt users to write on their journal.</p>
        <p>- We have the Object we can call it Journal this is where tell the app what to do</p>
        <p>- And we have other classes that help them carry out the instructions "how to do it"</p>
        <p>-    public class Journal (this object or class gives the instructions)</p>
        
               <p>Public List<AddEntry> _entries = new List<AddEntry>(); (now he instructed to add enteries, now we need another class to tell us specifically how to add the enteries) </p>
               <p> Public PromptGenerator pgen = new PromptGenerator(); (same here we need a differnt command to tell us how the prompt works in details)</p>
       <p>  [ public class PromptGenerator</p>
        
           <p> public List<string> _prompt = new List<string>()</p>
            
                "What are you grateful about today?",
                "What was the best part of your day?",
                "What did you gain today and what will you like to remember about today?"
            
                <p> public Random rnd = new Random(); </p>
        
                <p>public string GetPrompt()</p>
            
                <p>int index = rnd.Next(_prompt.Count);</p>
                return _prompt[index];
                // RETURN prompts[index]
                <p> All these line of code in [] gives the details command on what prompt the program gives.</p>
