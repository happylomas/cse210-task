        <h2>Encapsulation</h2>
        <h3>Explain the meaning of Encapsulation</h3>
        <p>- Encapsulation is the act of enclosing your code basically to prevent unwanted access.
            You can say that it is a principle of keeping some code private mostly code that will likly not change easily.
        </p>
        <h3>Highlight a benefit of Encapsulation</h3>
        <p>- Encapsulation help to reduce the complexity of a code</p>
        <p>- Encapsulation Makes it easier for programmers  to maintain  code and avoide too many changes when developing a program.</p>
        <p>- It helps programmers to reuse a code or function instead of rewriting a code over and over again.</p>
        <p>- Encapsulation helps keep codes or method private, so other class will not access them without a getter or an allowed source.</p>
        <h3>Application of Encapsulation</h3>
        <p>- Encapsulation are mainly use in privatizing object in a class </p>
        <p>- For example. In the Scripture Memorizer, we encapsulate each wordâ€™s text and visibility inside a Word class. 
            The Scripture class holds a private List<Word> and calls Word methods to hide or display words. 
        </p>

            <p>private string _text;</p>
            <p>private bool _isHidden;</p>


        <h3>Example of Encapsulation</h3>
        <p>- This is a program that help primary student memorize Scripture verses.</p>
        <p>- Now we have a class called Reference, this class has virables that we kept private, and also a constructor that 
            tells us how we can display them. There's also a getter, and then a display function that is public.
        </p>
        <p>- And we have other classes that help the program, but cannot maipulate these private objects."</p>
        <p>- Encapsulation simply make it possible for us to keep things we don't wish to keep changing in a private mode.</p>
